Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a FedEx logistics dataset. The dataset includes detailed information about various shipments, such as project codes, shipment modes, product details, freight costs, and more.
The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset, which can potentially optimize logistics processes and improve decision-making.
Dataset Information
The dataset contains 10,324 entries and 33 columns, with key details such as:
* Shipment Information: Project code, shipment mode, shipment dates, and delivery dates.
* Product Information: Product group, brand, dosage form, item description, and more.
* Logistics Information: Weight, freight costs, insurance costs, and manufacturing site details.
Columns in the Dataset:
1. ID: Unique identifier for each entry
2. Project Code: Code associated with the logistics project
3. Country: Country of the shipment
4. Managed By: Person or team managing the shipment
5. Fulfill Via: Method used to fulfill the shipment
6. Vendor INCO Term: Vendor shipping terms
7. Shipment Mode: Mode of shipment (e.g., air, sea, land)
8. Scheduled Delivery Date: Scheduled delivery date for the shipment
9. Delivered to Client Date: Actual delivery date
10. Delivery Recorded Date: Date when the delivery was recorded
11. Product Group: Group under which the product is categorized
12. Sub Classification: Subcategory of the product group
13. Vendor: Vendor supplying the product
14. Item Description: Description of the item

26. Weight (Kilograms): Weight of the shipment (some missing values)
27. Freight Cost (USD): Cost of shipping in USD
28. Line Item Insurance (USD): Insurance cost for the shipment
Missing Data:
* Shipment Mode: 60 missing values
* Dosage: 736 missing values
* Line Item Insurance (USD): 287 missing values
* Weight (Kilograms): Missing data for some entries
* Freight Cost (USD): Missing values for some shipments
Steps Involved in the EDA
1. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
2. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand trends, patterns, and correlations.
3. Descriptive Statistics: Analyze key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
4. Exploratory Analysis: Investigate relationships between different columns, focusing on shipment modes, cost analysis, and product details.
5. Insights and Recommendations: Provide insights to optimize logistics processes.
